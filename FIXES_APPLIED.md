# Fixes Applied to Grain Size Analysis Application

## Issue Fixed
**Error:** "MainWindow object has no attribute 'available_methods'" when loading files and during analysis.

## Root Cause
The application had references to an old `available_methods` dictionary that was removed when we simplified the method selection UI. The initialization order was also incorrect, causing attributes to not exist when needed.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed References to `available_methods`
- **File:** `gui/main_window.py`
- Replaced `self.available_methods` with `self.method_checkboxes`
- Updated method selection to use `get_selected_methods()` instead of dictionary lookups

### 2. Fixed Initialization Order
- **Problem:** `method_checkboxes` was initialized after `setup_ui()` was called
- **Solution:** Moved initialization of data structures to the beginning of `__init__` before UI setup
- This ensures all attributes exist when UI components are created

### 3. Simplified Method Selection
- Removed `MethodSelectionDialog` class entirely
- Added method checkboxes directly to the Results tab
- Methods are now immediately visible and accessible

### 4. Fixed Control Panel Integration
- Updated to use actual CSV files instead of Excel references
- Connected DataLoader properly to the control panel
- Simplified column mapping (auto-detection only)

## Current Status
✅ Application loads CSV files without errors
✅ Grain size distribution plots display correctly
✅ K-value calculations work with all methods
✅ Export functionality operational
✅ No attribute errors during normal operation

## Testing Performed
- `test_data_flow.py` - Validates CSV loading and K calculations
- `test_gui_quick.py` - Checks GUI initialization
- `test_app_full.py` - Tests complete workflow

All tests pass successfully.
